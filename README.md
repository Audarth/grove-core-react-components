# MarkLogic-UI-Resource (Muir) React Components

This library provides a set of React components useful for building applications backed by a MarkLogic database.

## Getting Started

### Installation

    npm install --save muir-core-react-components

or

    yarn add muir-core-react-components

### Implementation

If you are using these React components as stand-alone components, rather than as part of a Muir Project generated by the muir-cli, you will need to create a React container in your host application to pass the necessary props and callback functions to the Muir React components that you are importing. See the [`MLSearchContainer`](https://project.marklogic.com/repo/projects/NACW/repos/muir-react-template/browse/ui/src/containers/MLSearchContainer.js) in the Muir React UI Template for an example of doing this, using Redux modules. Also, look at [`App.js`](https://project.marklogic.com/repo/projects/NACW/repos/muir-react-template/browse/ui/src/App.js) and [`index.js`](https://project.marklogic.com/repo/projects/NACW/repos/muir-react-template/browse/ui/src/App.js) to see how selectors and actions are passed to `MLSearchContainer`.

## Components

### <DetailView />

This component provides a default view of a single document, together with some error handling. It can be customized. See: https://wiki.marklogic.com/display/SAL/MUIR+React+Developer+Starter+Guide

### <SearchResults />

The default behavior of the SearchResults component is to offer a choice between a CardResult and a ListResult. It can be customized. See: https://wiki.marklogic.com/display/SAL/MUIR+React+Developer+Starter+Guide

### Storybook

We are creating a storybook for all the components present in this library. To see it, for the moment, clone this repository and run:

    npm run storybook

## Contributing

### Local Development of `muir-core-react-components`

You can use npm to link your local version of muir-core-react-components into an existing Muir React UI Application. First go into your `muir-core-react-components` directory and run the following to create a link on your machine from the name `muir-core-react-components` to this directory:

    cd {path-to-your-copy-of-muir-core-react-components}
    npm link

We need just one version of React. Because of the way the Node package manager (npm) can duplicate dependencies, this means we have to link your local `muir-core-react-components`'s version of React to your host application's.

    npm link {path-to-your-muir-project}/ui/node_modules/react

To complete the link, go into your Muir Project's `/ui` directory and run:

    cd {path-to-your-muir-project}/ui
    npm link muir-core-react-components

In order to see your changes to muir-core-react-components in your Muir Project, you will have to build muir-core-react-components:

    cd {path-to-your-copy-of-muir-core-react-components}
    npm run build

### Tests

    npm run test

To run the tests continuously as you change files:

    npm run test:watch

To get a report on test coverage:

    npm run test:coverage
    open coverage/html/index.html

### Stories

Best practice is to add a story for each component that gets exported from this library. We are using [Storybook](https://github.com/storybooks/storybook) for this, which is a form of live documentation. At least, there should be a story example for each supported state of the component. It is also possible to make interactive examples, though this is more work. See <Facets /> for an example.

Eventually, we may tie stories together with testing. This could follow the model [described in this article](https://medium.com/@mlthuret/building-a-react-components-living-documentation-using-react-storybook-5f11f0e7d23e).

To create a story for a component, save it as a new file ending with '.story.js'. See the codebase for examples.

### Code-Style and Linting

TODO: Describe ESLint, benefits of linting javascript, and the benefits of a common code-style. Also, how to set up editor-support.

TODO: We should enforce linting as part of the build.

## Optional Badges

TODO: Evaluate which to keep.
